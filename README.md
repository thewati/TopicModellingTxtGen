# Topic Modelling (LDA) and Text Generation (GPT-3) with Environmental/Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Data
This repo covers Topic Modelling and Text Generation. For the Topic Modelling task, the LDA model was used, while a replication of GPT-3  was used for Text Generation. Of course a replication of it was used due to limited resources. The task focuses on environmental issues: protecting forests, biodiversity and more
